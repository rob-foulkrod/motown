# Class Labs

These are the hands-on labs we may work through in class. Each lab is a free,
self-paced exercise from [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com/) and most are
paired with a matching [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/)
module. Work through them in any order.

!!! tip "How the labs work"
    GitHub Skills labs run inside a real repository. When you start a lab, GitHub
    creates a copy for you and a friendly bot walks you through each step by
    opening issues and reviewing your pull requests.

### Lab 12 — Make your first open source contribution

- **Module:** Supplemental (First Contributions) — hands-on open source workflow
- **Audience:** Beginners making their very first contribution to a project
- **Duration:** Less than 30 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Try out Git, Introduction to GitHub, Reviewing pull requests
  (Labs 1, 2, and 3 above)
- **Scenario:** First Contributions simplifies and guides the way beginners make
  their first contribution. You fork a real repository, add your name to a list,
  and open a pull request — practicing the full contribution workflow end to end.
- **What you'll do:**
    1. **Fork the repository.** Click the **Fork** button at the top of the
       project page to create a copy in your own account. (If you don't have Git
       installed yet, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
       first.)
    2. **Clone your fork.** Open your forked repository, click the **Code** button,
       copy the URL, then run `git clone "url you just copied"` to download it to
       your machine.
    3. **Create a branch.** Change into the repository directory
       (`cd first-contributions`) and create a branch with
       `git switch -c your-new-branch-name`.
    4. **Make and commit your change.** Open `Contributors.md`, add your name
       somewhere in the middle of the file, and save. Then stage and commit it:
       `git add Contributors.md` followed by
       `git commit -m "Add your-name to Contributors list"`.
    5. **Push your changes.** Send the branch to your fork with
       `git push -u origin your-branch-name`.
    6. **Open a pull request.** Back on GitHub, click the **Compare & pull
       request** button to submit your change for review.
